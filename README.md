### About

I am a Software Engineering graduate focused on building structured, production-ready systems with clarity and long-term scalability in mind. My work combines practical full-stack development with disciplined system design and strong fundamentals in object-oriented programming and data structures. I am particularly interested in backend architecture and applied machine learning systems.
